# 👋 Hi, I'm Alfian Aswinda!

A remote-first Fullstack Software Engineer who loves turning imagination into working code. I thrive on solving real-world problems with elegant web solutions—and yes, I’m the kind of dev who builds robot UIs for fun (and work 😎).

🚀 Currently at [MovelAI](https://movel.ai/) (Singapore)  
🧠 Learning **Rust** and **Mobile Dev**  
🛠️ Deepening mastery in **Golang** and **TypeScript** through daily code battles  
🤖 Passionate about **Robotics**, **AI**, and future tech  
🤝 Open to collaborating on **Backend**, **Frontend**, or **Fullstack** projects  
💬 Ping me if you're into tech, startups, or building something awesome
